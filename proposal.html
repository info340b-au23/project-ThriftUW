    <h1>Problem Description (Problem/Data Domain)</h1>
    <p>
        Our proposed project focuses on creating an online thrift store & social media integration tailored for students at the University of Washington. 
        The data we will present can be extracted from other sources of online fashion sellers local to students(Facebook Marketplace). 
        Using this information, we can mimic how the website will function, focusing on personalized profiles that will sell the items we gathered. 
        The general topic of interest is sustainable fashion and accessible thrift shopping for college students.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Problems that need addressing</li>
        <li>
            Access to affordable fashion: College students often face financial constraints and are constantly seeking affordable yet stylish clothing options.
            Thrift shopping is the best alternative for a budget-friendly and sustainable option but finding the best thrift store items can be challenging.
        </li>
        <li>
            Community and inspiration: It helps students to find style inspiration from the community around them. 
            They want to see what their peers are wearing and discover unique clothing while promoting sustainable fashion practices. 
            RSOs such as FittedUW can benefit from having an online fashion community.
        </li>
        <li>
            Convenience and Financial Independence: Shopping at multiple thrift stores can be time-consuming and expensive depending on distances travelled. Developing a
            thrift-centric site that filters out the need to spend hours outside searching for good apparel/deals can help streamline
            the overall process. This site would also provide entrepreneurial opportunities for UW students, allowing them to sell their items
            and immediately support the thrifting community through their own purchases or their own thrifting businesses.

        </li>
        <li>Sustainability: Along with the trend of thrifting due to social media influences, purchasing second-hand clothing 
            tends to be a more sustainable option. It reduces environmental impact, as well as fulfills people's desires to own
            luxury items at a fraction of the cost. 
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        Sites such as Depop and Pinterest and online vendors/influencers on social media apps already exist. 
        However, the platforms lack a localized and community-centered approach for UW students. 
        Also, most of these generic online thrift stores lack features that help students discover thrift stores or sellers local to the area.
    </p>
    <p>
        This proposed website aims to bridge the gap by offering a dedicated platform where students can create profiles, post pictures of outfits, 
        list clothing items for sale, and follow others in the UW community. The platform will also provide features to tag clothing with locations where to find products. 
        The goal is to address the specific needs of UW students, making thrift shopping more accessible and sustainable to promote fashion culture within the campus community.

    <h1> Proposed Application (App Description)</h1>
    <p>
        The primary users of this application are University of Washington Students. Those who are intersted in fashion
        and thrifting would use this application. The group of UW students could be undergrad or graduatuate students either living
        on campus or off campus. All users come from very diverse background of ethnicity, majors, year, religion and more. Their is
        definitly positive and negative impacts this application can have on minority groups. One positive is inclusivity. 
        This platform hosts so many diverse senses of style from students that come from very diverse backgrounds. This platform
        with all empower students to branch out with their style choices. It is a way for students to express themselves through 
        fashion and display their unique individualism with their peers. 
    </p>
    <p>The UW thrift app aims to connect one another through creativity and shared interests within the community. College is a time of exploration, 
        discover, and learning. Often times, we express ourselves through our unique styles. We want to provide a platform for students to share their 
        unique selves, as well as discover new ways to express themselves, while keeping within their budgets. On a higher level, we hope to create an impact 
        through our app to promote sustainability, decrease environment impacts and fast fashion. We strive to preserve individuality, while we contribute on 
        improving issues that are bigger than ourselves. 
    </p>
    <p>
        That being said, the features on our platform are catered to user needs. Our target audience are mainly students around the UW area. The main 
        features that are implemented will allow users to post and sell their own clothing, purchase posted clothing items from other users, message other users, 
        and engage with the community by interacting with user posts (different from posts that sell clothing items).
