ThriftUW App Development. By Ethan Wang, Nikola Cumic, Anita Tan & Nikki Suneel 

Fashion thrift website for UW students
    - Students create a profile and are incentivized to either post pictures highlighting their outfits or list clothing items to sell on their profile(login credentials) 
    - Students will have a feed page where they can be updated on other users ’ profiles that they follow 
    - The feed will contain pictures of people’s outfits with tagged locations of where to find certain clothing items(thrift shops or retail stores) or listed clothes for sale

Our proposed project focuses on creating an online thrift store & social media integration tailored for students at the University of Washington. The data we will present can be extracted from other sources of online fashion sellers local to students(Facebook Marketplace). Using this information, we can mimic how the website will function, focusing on personalized profiles that will sell the items we gathered. The general topic of interest is sustainable fashion and accessible thrift shopping for college students.

Problems that need addressing:
    - Access to affordable fashion: College students often face financial constraints and are constantly seeking affordable yet stylish clothing options. Thrift shopping is the best alternative for a budget-friendly and sustainable option but finding the best thrift store items can be challenging.
    - Community and inspiration: It helps students to find style inspiration from the community around them. They want to see what their peers are wearing and discover unique clothing while promoting sustainable fashion practices. RSOs such as FittedUW can benefit from having an online fashion community.

Sites such as Depop and Pinterest and online vendors/influencers on social media apps already exist. However, the platforms lack a localized and community-centered approach for UW students. Also, most of these generic online thrift stores lack features that help students discover thrift stores or sellers local to the area.
This proposed website aims to bridge the gap by offering a dedicated platform where students can create profiles, post pictures of outfits, list clothing items for sale, and follow others in the UW community. The platform will also provide features to tag clothing with locations where to find products. The goal is to address the specific needs of UW students, making thrift shopping more accessible and sustainable to promote fashion culture within the campus community.

App description

Types of information users will see & how our app alleviates the problem presented in the problem statement.
The UW thrift app aims to connect one another through creativity and shared interests within the community. College is a time of exploration, discover, and learning. Often times, we express ourselves through our unique styles. We want to provide a platform for students to share their unique selves, as well as discover new ways to express themselves, while keeping within their budgets. On a higher level, we hope to create an impact through our app to promote sustainability, decrease environment impacts and fast fashion. We strive to preserve individuality, while we contribute on improving issues that are bigger than ourselves. 
That being said, the features on our platform are catered to user needs. Our target audience are mainly students around the UW area. The main features that are implemented will allow users to post and sell their own clothing, purchase posted clothing items from other users, message other users, and engage with the community by interacting with user posts (different from posts that sell clothing items).
